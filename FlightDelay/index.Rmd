## Flight Data Source

The US Department of Transportation Bureau of Transportation Statistics gathers data on virtually all scheduled flights between points in the United States and territories.

- Data include scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, wheels-up, wheels-on time, and whether the flight was cancelled or diverted to another destination.
- Monthly data is available from 1995 through November, 2014 (as of January 20, 2015) and covers >500 thousand flights per month.
- For the purposes of this analysis and application, flight outcomes were grouped into four categories: On-time, Delayed, Diverted, or Cancelled
